# Challenge Diary

Same as last year, I started a few days late.

## Day 1

Simple puzzle. The only thing that tripped me up for a second was the timing of calculating the additional fuel. I first
thought to do it after the calculating the fuel for the entire ship/system and then realized that it needed to be done
per module.

# Challenge Diary

Same as last year, I started a few days late.

## Day 1

Simple puzzle. The only thing that tripped me up for a second was the timing of calculating the additional fuel. I first
thought to do it after the calculating the fuel for the entire ship/system and then realized that it needed to be done
per module.

## Day 2

Surprised they went to an opcode puzzle so early this year. Really basic for a first one though, and probably the base
that we will expand upon later. The core logic was different enough for part 2 that I split it out to another script.
